I agree that algorithims are subjective and reflect people's
attitudes and behavior. Algorithims learn based on the information
that they receive. The information that they receive comes from people
and thus they learn the attitudes and behavior of people. Because of 
this, I believe that algorithims are really subjective and can 
potentially be as subjective as people are because they learn from 
people.
